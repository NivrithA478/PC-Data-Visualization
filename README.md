This project centers around Pancreatic Cancer Detection using urinary biomarkers, a method that is relatively new, and its efficiency in the medicinal world. This file investigates the relationships between the different biomarkers and their abundance in patients with and without pancreatic cancer. Around 64,050 people get pancreatic cancer each year, and studies have suggested that urinary biomarker tests are more substantial than regular blood tests due to time efficiency and accuracy, precision, F1-Score, and recall efficiency. 590 patients have been examined, including healthy controls, patients with non-cancerous pancreatic conditions, like chronic pancreatitis, and patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In addition to keeping in account age and sex, four biomarkers were stored in the data to be used for future tests: Creatine, a protein that is often used as an indicator of kidney function, YVLE1, a lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, a protein that may play a role in tumor metastasis, REG1B, a protein that may be associated with pancreas regeneration, and TFF1, a trefoil factor 1, which may be related to regeneration and repair of the urinary tract. Explore the different relationships between the abundance of these biomarkers, the age, and the sex compared to patients with and without pancreatic cancer!
